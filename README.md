How to Install the server
Please setup your firewall on your server prior to running the script.

Make sure you have got access via ssh or otherwise setup prior setting up the firewall, command for UFW is:

ufw allow proto tcp from YOURIP to any port 22
If you have UFW installed use the following commands (you only need port 8000 if you are using the preconfigured install files):

ufw allow 21115:21119/tcp
ufw allow 8000/tcp
ufw allow 21116/udp
sudo ufw enable
Run the following commands:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dinger1986/rustdeskinstall/master/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
Choose your preferences from the options given in the script.

Please Note: If you allow the script to create preconfigured install files (with your IP/DNS and key set) it will install gohttpserver using port 8000 for you to easily download the install scripts.

Run the following commands:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/techahold/rustdeskinstall/master/update.sh
chmod +x update.sh
